            <h3>by Falling in reverse</h3>
            <p> I got voices in my head again, tread carefully <br>
            And I don't medicate, it helps me temporarily<br>
            I got problems I got issues yeah, apparently <br>
            Trauma that I'm burying <br>
            I think I need some therapy <br>
            I battle depression <br>
            I'm back with a message <br>
            I'm asking the question <br>
            That if you hate me <br>
            Why you actin obsessive? <br>
            I'm past the point of no return <br>
            Fuck being passive aggressive <br>
            I'll brandish a weapon <br>
            And teach all you motherfuckers a lesson <br>
            I actually battle my demons and shadows <br>
            They swim in the deep and creep in the shallows <br>
            I'm lost <br>
            I gotta admit that <br>
            I'm livin the life That <br>
            I've always wanted <br>
            But it comes at a cost <br>
            They're lickin their chops <br>
            Their fixing to rip me apart <br>
            I'm swimming with sharks I'm liftin the bar <br>
            I'm liftin it into the stars <br>
            I'm like a shot of adrenaline <br>
            Mixed with some Ritalin <br>
            You started a battle, but bitch, I'ma finish it <br>
            You think you can stop me not even a lil bit <br>
            Nowadays everybody's so sensitive <br>
            Taking my words and you pick it apart <br>
            Tripping on nothing just get in the car <br>
            Gripping and ripping, I'm sticking the mark <br>
            I'm tipping the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-charts <br><br>
            
            'Cause I got enemies trying to get rid of me <br>
            Evil tendencies are fucking with me mentally <br>
            I got people that don't like me in the industry <br>
            I can feel your energy <br>
            You are not a friend to me <br>
            'Cause I have been to places that you never wanna go <br>
            I got dirt on people but they act like I don't know <br>
            I could do some damage but I'll never rock the boat <br>
            All it takes is one post <br>
            Watch 'em fall like dominoes
